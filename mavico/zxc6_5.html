                <h1>What advice would I give to
                    my younger self if  I could go back to  the start
                   of my career</h1>
                   <p class="outline-text"><i>There is an expression: growing up is when you put on a hat, even if your mom asks you to put on a hat. Only with experience and age do you realize what and how you could have done in the past better, more productive, and more correctly. Whose advice to listen to and accept, and whose "help" to refuse forever. Therefore, the main advice is to live and feel everything that happens with an open mind and a desire to accept it, understand it and make the right conclusions for the future.

                    I also want to give advice that is relevant at any time.
                    
                    Do not chase after quick money and think about prospects. What is important is what the employer can offer in addition to salary: valuable experience and competencies, useful contacts, significant projects in the portfolio. What you do should work for the customer. How you do it should work for you.
                    
                    Constantly improve in the execution of tasks, try new approaches, tools and technologies. Don't be afraid to try things out, ask questions, and take bumps. There are no people who have never made a mistake.
                    
                    Keep up with and learn new technologies. And read, read, read. Organize yourself or have others organize you. Read good books on personal effectiveness and build your own system of doing things.
                    
                    Don't let turnover and fires at work distract you from tasks that work for the future.
                    
                    Be bold and stand up for your professional ideas, but also be humble in front of those who surpass you. </i>              </div>
